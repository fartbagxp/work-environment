# Work Environment

This is a backup of my development environment for both Windows and Linux (Fedora).

My work environment has gotten more complicated with multiple git accounts, multiple operating system, and many different application settings.

Before this repository, I would simply back up certain handy scripts on gist.github.com, but the scale of my day to day has grown beyond what I can remember on gist.

## What you'll find

* Application setting backups (SSH, git configs, bash startup scripts, aliases)

* Issues with Linux (wifi card fails after kernel update)

* How to setup a consistent environment across different platform.

## Scope

* [Windows based setup](windows/README.md)

* [Linux based setup](linux/README.md)

* [Shared app setup](app-settings/README.md)
